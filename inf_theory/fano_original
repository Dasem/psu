Advanced English reading texts : while the majority of texts in this resource are at CEF levels C1,  a few are harder (level C2) and a few are easier (level B2). All the texts in this collection are written in normal English, not in simplified English; however most have been deliberately written for readers for whom English is a foreign or second language, or else for high school students. 
   Most have also been written for international readers whose home culture is not British or American.
   For this reason they avoid (or explain)  linguistic or cultural references that are unlikely to be understood by readers without the background of native speakers
